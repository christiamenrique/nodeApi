# nodeApi


  * I created a JSON file that has 10 employees in it, employeeID, name, salary and department name.
  * Then, I created an express API so that when the client hits the endpoint with a GET request it will receive the data on the employees.
  * If the client hits the endpoint with the employeeID, it only will receive the information on that one employee.
  * If the client hits the endpoint with an incorrect employeeID, it will send back the correct HTTP status code and an error message stating that the employee was not found.
  * The client is allowed to add, delete and update an employee.
